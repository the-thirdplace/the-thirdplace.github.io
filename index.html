   <h4>What is The Third Place?</h4>
   <p>
    Hi. I'm nav, and this is The Third Place.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>The Third Place</i> is a place that's not your home or your workplace but a social setting where you can be youself and build community outside of family/work based on your thoughts, ideas and interests. 
   </p>
    Similarly, this blog is neither a personal diary nor a social media account but a medium to communicate in my purest form, to share my thoughts, ideas and interests and to build a community I resonate with.
