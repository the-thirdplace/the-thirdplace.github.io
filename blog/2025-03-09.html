   <h1>The gifted child who was really just average</h1>
   <p>
    Starting a blog was not how I imagined the month of March, 2025 would look like for me. It was a very spontaneous decision and for someone, who is now in her early twenties and on a path to healing, it seemed like the right thing to do. It's never too late to try new things and figure out whether or not you like them once you have true freedom to try them, and the freedom to decide if you truly like them. 
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>The true freedom in question is willingness.</i>
   </p>
   <p>
   Doing things and liking them out of willingness, genuinely wanting to and not out of any obligation, having to because you were told, is a cathartic experience I believe every 'former gifted child' must experience.
   </p>
   <p>
    By definition, 'gifted children' are thosewho demonstrate an advanced ability or potential in one or more specific areas when compared to others of the same age, experience or environment.Similarly, ‘gifted child burnout’ is when a gifted child experiences exhaustion, frustration, and diminished motivation due to persistent pressure to excel and meet high expectations.
   </p>
   <p>
   However, there are also 'gifted children' who are, in reality, just average. The category of children who are supposedly 'gifted', yet envious of others their age because in many cases, this 'gift' of being better than everyone else comes from the parents' fear of their child being average. The 'gift' is forced by comparing them to other kids. This 'gift' comes from forced consistency, stripping the child of freedom of choice. These children perform well, not because they have a motivational drive to, but because they're made to, because they're told they should. These are the same children who grow into adults who do certains things not because they want to, but because now it's rooted into them that they should.
   </p>
   <p>
    A child stripped of willingness is an adult, that they'll grow up to be, stripped of personality.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, these children, when they grow up and finally seem to have free will, the very first thing they do is get back control of their life. They make a choice. When your entire life of nearly 17 years, you are forced to be consistent with something you neither liked nor were good at, gaining control can look a lot like breaking that routine, that forced consistency. Telling yourself you don't know why it has suddenly become hard to even pick up a book when it is something you're unconsciously doing to feel like the one in-charge of your life, which people usually equate to 'destroying your own life'. When in reality, you 'destroying your own life' is just you being average.

   If extra tuition classes and cram schools was what made me gifted, I'd rather be average.
   </p>
   <p>Following is a quote from <b>Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop (Hwang Bo-Reum)</b> page 220-<br>
   <i>'Really? Do I have to do something I like? But I can't think of anything. Nothing I particularly enjoy or get excited about. To him, everything was just about the same as any other. Sometimes he might find something interesting, but soon, he'd get bored of it. He'd never felt strongly about anything - that he'd die if he didn't get to do it - nor was there anything he hated to do so much that he'd rather die. He wasn't particularly good at anything, either. He was simply average, and ordinary, at everything in life. How should he navigate a life in which there was nothing he liked, or was good at? He was lost.'</i>
   </p>
   <p>
    For a society that always expects people to fit in, it sure does side eye average people a lot. 
   </p>
   <p>
   As an adult, or as someone transitioning into adult life, this concept is now easier to understand that there were indeed things I would've liked to do, or could've been good at, but I denied myself the pleasure of to feel a sense of control over my life. However, I do not regret it because now I'm doing them out of willingness, to look for pleasure in consistency. The same consistency that bound me to a routine I so badly wanted to break out of, now provides me with stability. The thin line between both of these is willingness. 
   </p>
   <p>
   Because I was not allowed to be average back then, because I was supposed to cherish the 'gift' that I never really had, getting to choose to be average out of free will was the most liberating thing I experienced.
