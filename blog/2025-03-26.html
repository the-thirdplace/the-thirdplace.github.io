   <h1>Spring has arrived, my heart is in full bloom.</h1>
   <p>
    The color green is more calming than ever. Yellow and red are vibrant enough to overshadow the winter blues. This particular blue colored sky is what gives the air this fresh fragrance and the birds new songs to sing. Eyes don't get tired of looking around and it feels like a punishment to shut them close when you finally know spring has arrived, and hearts are in full bloom, and you don't want it to wither away anytime soon. 
   </p>
   <p>
    So, I wrote down something that's been on my mind these days to keep the bloom for longer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Recently, I learned in class that in many medical conditions, there are two phases.
Exacerbation; an acute increase in the severity of the problem, when we're supposed to provide treatment and comfort.
Remission; when the body tries to recover on its own, that's when we're supposed to aid the body's natural recovery process and use that momentum for further strengthening as well. The same concept can be applied outside medicine.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>When you're having bad days, the main goal should be self-care and comforting yourself.</b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Self-care is the practice of taking an active role in protecting one's own well-being and happiness, in particular during periods of stress. This is the textbook definition of self-care which further tells us self-care doesn't have to look like a particular task, or be done in a specific way, there are no universal methods of self care that would 100% work for all. For some, it could look like writing, creating, exercising, dancing and moving their body and for some, it could look like simply laying in bed without guilt, watching a movie or eating their comfort food. So you should experiment and see what works the best for you, with the main goal of having a mind that feels rested and refreshed in the end. 
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>When you feel like it is a good day, or a streak of good days is going on, ride that momentum</b> and make the most of it, productivity-wise, consistency-wise, movement-wise and to strengthen yourself in whatever way you'd like to.
   </p>
   <p>
    These are the days where your body and mind seem to be in sync, take advantage of that and get to work. A way to not lose motivation when you have a lot on your to-do list is to complete the smaller tasks first, the sense of accomplishment will push you to complete other tasks as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    Get as much movement in as you can, it could be anywhere between 10 minute stretching to a full-fledged gym session. It could be dancing or running, or it could simply be your favorite sport played with friends. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Try to do dishes and laundry regularly on your good days, it'll keep them from piling up and haunting you on days you only need your bed. Do all the small tasks from dusting to organising to talking to a friend during these days. Especially talking to a friend because if they're present during your bad days, they deserve to see you in your prime too.
   </p>
   <p>
    These three simple (maybe not) things will take half of the stress off your mind and give you space to get creative and busy with other things that need attention and thus, keep the bloom longer before it goes away and the cycle repeats.
