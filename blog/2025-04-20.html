   <h1>The distance between being just somebody and being yourself.</h1>
   <p>
    You've probably heard the phrase "be yourself" at least once during the low moments in your life, meant to cheer you up and give you strength to carry on. Of course, what is better than facing all the challenges head on while being your authentic self, right? 
   </p>
   <p>
    What is this 'you' people keep telling you to be?
   </p>
   <p>
    Collecting the fragments of others' perception of you and building a personality out of that, is that you?<br>
    Having a rigid set of principles and refusing to ever change them regardless of your own needs, is that you?<br>
    Having no opinions of your own, always choosing to be neutral even if you can clearly see the imbalanced scale, is that you? 
   </p>
   <p>
    Who are you?
   </p>
   <p>
    You are what you consume. The books you read, the films you watch, the food you eat, the music you listen to, the people you talk to, the environment you live in, the street you walk through daily, your favorite form of photography, the youtube videos that teach geography, the sounds around you at early morning, the coffee which is way too dark for your liking, the degree of your choice, the job you're working, that neighborhood art gallery, that concert which is too expensive. You are your internal monologue, you are what's on your phone's screen. You are what you consume deliberately, whether or not you like it.
   </p>
   <p>
    You are what you express. The late night diary entry, the weekly junk journalling, the songs you hum while cooking the dish that is your expertise, the things you say while consoling, the way you are when listening, the way you speak, the way you move, whenever you laugh, wherever you look, the affirmations and the complaints, your tablecloth with coffee stains, the red lipstick you wear, your unintentional tear. You are your internal monologue, you are what's on your diary. You are what you express, whether or not you want it.
   </p>
   <p>
    You'll learn a lot just with these two, walking the road we call life, covering the distance in a stride, from being just somebody to being you.
